Application template for Red Hat Decision Manager Execution Server 7.0 application built using S2I.

toc::[]


== Parameters

Templates allow you to define parameters which take on a value. That value is then substituted wherever the parameter is referenced.
References can be defined in any text field in the objects list field. Refer to the
https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/templates.html#parameters[Openshift documentation] for more information.

|=======================================================================
|Variable name |Image Environment Variable |Description |Example value |Required

|`APPLICATION_NAME` | -- | The name for the application. | myapp | True

|`KIE_SERVER_ID` | `KIE_SERVER_ID` | Decision server identifier. Determines the template ID in Decision Central or controller. If this parameter is left blank, it is set using the $HOSTNAME environment variable or a random value. (Sets the org.kie.server.id system property). | `${KIE_SERVER_ID}` | False
|`KIE_SERVER_BYPASS_AUTH_USER` | `KIE_SERVER_BYPASS_AUTH_USER` | KIE execution server bypass auth user. If this parameter is set to true, the Decision Server accepts API calls without user account authorization. (Sets the org.kie.server.bypass.auth.user system property). | false | False

When this parameter is set to true, the Decision Server extension accepts custom classes annotated by the XmlRootElement or Remotable annotations only. Setting to true is preferable for performance, but some custom decision services might require false. (Sets the org.drools.server.filter.classes system property). | true | False
|`EXECUTION_SERVER_HOSTNAME_HTTP` | -- | Custom hostname for http service route.  Leave blank for default hostname, example: <application-name>-execserv-<project>.<default-domain-suffix> | -- | False

This information identifies the decision service (KJAR file) that is built from your source. You can provide two or more KJAR files using the `\|` separator, for example: `containerId=groupId:artifactId:version\|c2=g2:a2:v2`. The Maven build process must produce all these files from the source in the Git repository. | rhdm-kieserver-hellorules=org.openshift.quickstarts:rhdm-kieserver-hellorules:1.4.0-SNAPSHOT | False

|`MAVEN_MIRROR_URL` | -- | Maven mirror to use for S2I builds. If the Maven build of your decision service pulls packages from a Maven repository, you can set this parameter. In this case, the build process will pull packages from the mirror repository instead of the configured original repository. | -- | False

== Objects

The CLI supports various object types. A list of these object types as well as their abbreviations
can be found in the https://docs.openshift.org/latest/cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.html#object-types[Openshift documentation].


=== Services

A service is an abstraction which defines a logical set of pods and a policy by which to access them. Refer to the
https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/docs/services/[container-engine documentation] for more information.

|=============
|Service        |Port  |Name | Description

.1+| `${APPLICATION_NAME}-kieserver`
|8080 | --
.1+| The execution server web server's http port.
.1+| `secure-${APPLICATION_NAME}-kieserver`
|8443 | --
.1+| The execution server web server's https port.
|=============



=== Routes

A route is a way to expose a service by giving it an externally-reachable hostname such as `www.example.com`. A defined route and the endpoints
identified by its service can be consumed by a router to provide named connectivity from external clients to your applications. Each route consists
of a route name, service selector, and (optionally) security configuration. Refer to the
https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/architecture/core_concepts/routes.html[Openshift documentation] for more information.

|=============
| Service    | Security | Hostname

|`${APPLICATION_NAME}-kieserver-http` | none | `${EXECUTION_SERVER_HOSTNAME_HTTP}`
|`${APPLICATION_NAME}-kieserver-https` | TLS passthrough | `${EXECUTION_SERVER_HOSTNAME_HTTPS}`
|=============



=== Build Configurations

A `buildConfig` describes a single build definition and a set of triggers for when a new build should be created.
A `buildConfig` is a REST object, which can be used in a POST to the API server to create a new instance. Refer to
the https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/dev_guide/builds.html#defining-a-buildconfig[Openshift documentation]
for more information.

|=============


=== Deployment Configurations

A deployment in OpenShift is a replication controller based on a user defined template called a deployment configuration. Deployments are created manually or in response to triggered events.
Refer to the https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/dev_guide/deployments.html#creating-a-deployment-configuration[Openshift documentation] for more information.


==== Triggers

A trigger drives the creation of new deployments in response to events, both inside and outside OpenShift. Refer to the
https://access.redhat.com/beta/documentation/en/openshift-enterprise-30-developer-guide#triggers[Openshift documentation] for more information.

|============
|Deployment | Triggers

|`${APPLICATION_NAME}-kieserver` | ImageChange
|============



==== Replicas

A replication controller ensures that a specified number of pod "replicas" are running at any one time.
If there are too many, the replication controller kills some pods. If there are too few, it starts more.
Refer to the https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/docs/replicationcontrollers/[container-engine documentation]
for more information.
